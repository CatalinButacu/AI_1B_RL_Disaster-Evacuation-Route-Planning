Grading Method for Reinforcement Learning 
 
 
 
Grading is based on the following criteria: 
 
1. Laboratory activity – 20% 
 
2. Project – 20% 
 
3. Exam (multiple-choice test) – 60% 
 
 
 
Students who obtain an unrounded grade ≥10 in practical activities will receive a bonus of 0.1 
added to their final grade (for example, if they have 10 in the laboratory, 10 in the project, and 9 in 
the exam, their final grade will be 10). 
 
 
To pass the course, it is mandatory that (N1+N2)/2 and N3 are at least 5. 
Pentru promovare, este obligatoriu ca (N1+N2)/2 și N3 să fie minim 5.
