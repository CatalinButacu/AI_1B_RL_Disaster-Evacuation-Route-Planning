Policy gradients:
- training warehouse robots with limited physical trials
- video-game agents that learn from both experience and simulated rollouts
- smart thermostats that simulate building temperature dynamics
- dialogue systems that simulate future conversations
- recommendation systems (user preferences shift)
- finance/portfolio environments that shift with market conditions
- traffic control systems with daily/seasonal changes
- adaptive ad bidding systems
- robot navigation where risky explorations must be avoided
- drone flight where unsafe actions should never be taken
- autonomous wheelchairs (safest possible paths)
- deep RL in Atari games or continuous worlds
- autonomous vehicle lane-following
- trading algorithms that require stable value estimates
- robotics tasks with noisy sensors
- games where being in a good position matters more than specific actions
(e.g., defensive positions in strategy games)
- robotics where some states are inherently “safe”
- navigation tasks with large action spaces
- any sparse-reward environment
- high-performance video game agents (Atari, retro games)
- stock trading with discrete actions
- traffic light control
- industrial control with discrete actuator settings
- controlling robot joints
- manipulation robotics (grasping, reaching)
- power grid continuous control
- autonomous driving continuous steering/throttle

PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization):
MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search):
Hierarchical RL:
- humanoid locomotion (MuJoCo, physics simulators)
- self-driving car policies
- robotic arm manipulation
- text-generation RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback)
- turn-based games (Chess, Go, Shogi)
- puzzle solving (Sudoku, Rubik’s Cube solvers)
- autonomous systems that can “plan ahead” (robotic arm movement)
- real-time strategy (RTS) game decision-making
- household robots (clean room → pick up → store items)
- autonomous driving (navigate → change lane → park)
- manufacturing robots (assemble → weld → inspect)
- game AI with layered behavior (exploration → combat → retreat)
