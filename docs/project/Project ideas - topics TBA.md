1 Route Planning for Delivery Drones Using Dyna-Q
Build a drone navigation agent that uses a learned model to plan
routes and avoid obstacles, adjusting to wind or environment changes. Planning&model-based RL, Dyna-Q
WindyGridworld
2 Adaptive Traffic Light Control with Dyna-Q+
Represent changing traffic as stochasticity in a gridworld and adapt
with Dyna-Q+ exploration bonuses.
Dyna-Q+, non-stationary RL
custom env to simulate traffic light
3 Adaptive Trading Strategy Analogue with Sarsa(λ)
Treat price fluctuations like stochastic transitions, learning when to
“act” vs “hold”.
SARSA
custom env 
4 Robot Arm Control with Gaussian Policy Gradients
Use REINFORCE or A2C with a Gaussian policy to control a
continuous robotic joint.
policy gradients
Pendulum, double/triple pendulum
5 AlphaZero-Style Self-Play Using Gym Board Games propose a game and solve it using the algorithm
MCTS
Blackjack
6 Patient Treatment Scheduling in Hospitals
Plan sequences of treatments to reduce delays and resource conflicts. SARSA
custom env
7 Disaster Evacuation Route Planning
Find optimal evacuation routes in an uncertain environment.
Dyna-Q
custom env
8 Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Agent
An RL agent monitors signals and “acts” to block/allow connections.
